## Project name: ai-consultant-store

### Description:

The "ai-consultant-store" project was developed within the framework of university coursework and is an innovative solution to improve the shopping experience. Based on artificial intelligence and GPT-4 algorithms, the assistant offers personalized recommendations based on user needs and preferences. The peculiarity of the project is that you can communicate with it both by text and voice, which makes the process of choosing products more convenient and intuitive.

In the process of interacting with "ai-consultant-store", users can conveniently add selected products to a virtual cart. This functionality not only simplifies the selection process, but also allows customers to review their selections, make changes or make purchasing decisions at any time without rushing.

When the user is ready to place an order, the system generates a unique order number after confirming the selection of items in the cart. This number can then be presented to the seller, which allows him to quickly find the prepared order in the system and issue it after full payment. Thus, "ai-consultant-store" minimizes waiting time and makes the purchasing process more comfortable and organized for the client.

The project aims to improve retail by creating more personal, convenient and efficient shopping experiences, offering a modern approach to retail and increasing customer satisfaction.

### More information:

The "ai-consultant-store" project, developed using the open-source Deep Foundation technology, incorporates various APIs already implemented within Deep Foundation. These include Google Speech, Capacitor's Voice Recorder, OpenAI ChatGPT, Loyverse POS and etc, enhancing the project's functionality and offering a comprehensive user experience.

Deep Foundation uses a system based on PostgreSQL via Hasura, working with ternary and dual networking. It allows you to manage data and code through universal data exchange, with short-term interaction between different programs and languages. This approach ensures dynamic programming and data exchange, creating more universal and flexible software. More information can be found on the Deep Foundation page.

The project's use of TypeScript, JavaScript, React, Next.js, and Capacitor, combined with the core technologies of GraphQL, Hasura, Postgres, and MinIO provided by the Deep Foundation, illustrates a multi-faceted approach to building scalable, adaptive, and intuitive applications. By adding additional components to the NPM repositories, the project not only enriches the developer community, but also sets new standards for collaborative and open source development. This involves pushing the boundaries of what is possible, harnessing the collective power of these technologies to create a seamless and enriching user experience.
